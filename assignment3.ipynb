It must take a training dataset and an optional test dataset as input. The code must first identify categorical and numerical attributes, then handle missing values by imputing the mean for numerical attributes and the most frequent value for categorical attributes. It is worth noting that to determine if an attribute is numerical, the process should involve checking its data type and potentially examining the number of unique values. This is necessary because an attribute may appear to have an \"object\" data type but could, in fact, be numerical in nature.\n","\n","*  Subsequently, the \"preprocess\" code must standardize the numerical attributes by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance., and encodes categorical attributes using one-hot encoding.\n","\n","*  If a test dataset is provided, it must undergo the same preprocessing steps, ensuring that the imputation for missing values and data scaling are performed based on the values obtained from the training dataset, thus maintaining consistency between the two datasets.\n","\n","*  At the end, the function must return the preprocessed training and test datasets as (X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test) tuple if the test dataset exists.
